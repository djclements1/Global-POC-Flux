# Global-POC-Flux
Code and data nessecary to create the flux output for Clements et al. 2024 "Modeling the Diel Vertical Migration and Active Carbon Transport of zooplankton"


Scripts should be run in the following order
1. Make predictions
    This will generate predictions of the Biovolume and Slope 
2. Calc_3D_psd
     This will generate a matrix with size specific abundances
3. Linear_int_flux
     This will generate a mean export flux with varying vertical sinking carbon profiles.

All other files are needed to run the above codes. 
Needed data files are also included.
